scroll down to the section titled "Skip the sliding windows step once you know where the lines are"

Or, probably better, save per-detection-window state and reuse earlier frame with better-quality data.

This research paper http://airccj.org/CSCP/vol5/csit53211.pdf goes into how to detect curves
and will also help in detecting faded lanes. It uses an extended version of hough lines algorithm
to detect tangents to the curve which can help you detect the curve.

Here is another paper http://www.vision.caltech.edu/malaa/publications/aly08realtime.pdf
which talks about real time lane detection.
